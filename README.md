 The “Bank Account Management System” project is a model Internet Banking Site. This site enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. The customers can access the banks website for viewing their Account details and perform the transactions on account as per their requirements. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a concept of virtual banking a real shape. Thus today's banking is no longer confined to branches. E-banking facilitates banking transactions by customers round the clock globally.

## Features

- View balances: Firstly login your account with your account number and password. Then checking your balance doesn't require much work. You simply select Account balances and take a look at your balance and past transactions. If you have more than one account, you can also do transfers between accounts..
- Transfer funds: When you select Transfer Funds, you'll be asked where to transfer the money to and from, when, and the amount. 
- Set up recurring bill payments or transfers: If you make a regular payment every month, it might be convenient to set up an automatic withdrawal from your account.
- Monitor CIBC investments: If you have any CIBC investments, you can keep an eye on those stocks or mutual funds here.
- Pay bills: To pay your bills online, you just need to add to your account the names of the companies you wish to pay bills to.
- View our VISA* accounts: Always a good place to monitor your spending. You can make your credit card payments online, right from your account.
- Order Cheques: We don't need them much anymore due to online banking and debit purchases, but if you still use cheques, you can order them directly from the BAMS website.
